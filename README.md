#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer:

Software engineering is applying engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.

Importance of Software engineering in the technology industry;

1) Enables Innovation: Software Engineering is at the heart of innovation in technology. It allows us to create new applications, products, and services that drive progress and improve our lives. 

2) Ensures Reliability: Proper Software Engineering practices lead to more reliable and stable software, reducing the likelihood of crashes, errors, and system failures. This is crucial for critical applications in healthcare, transportation, and finance. 

3) Efficiency and Performance: Well-engineered software is optimised for efficiency and performance. It can handle tasks faster, consume fewer resources, and deliver a better user experience. 

4) Scalability and Adaptability: Software Engineering principles facilitate the development of scalable software that can grow with increasing demands. It also allows for easy adaptation to changing requirements and technologies. 

5) Cost-effective Solutions: Investing in Software Engineering upfront can lead to cost savings in the long run. Properly designed and maintained software requires fewer resources for maintenance and support. 

6) Security and Privacy: Software Engineering practices include security considerations, helping to protect data and systems from cyber threats. This is particularly crucial in an era of increasing digital vulnerabilities. 

7) Rapid Development and Iteration: Modern Software Engineering methodologies, such as Agile and DevOps, enable rapid development and iterative improvements, ensuring that software can keep up with evolving user needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer:

Mastering Machine (1956-1967)

Mastering Process (1968-1982)

Mastering Complexity (1983-1992)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Answer:

1) Planning
Planning, involves defining the software's purpose and scope, much like pinpointing our destination and plotting the best route.

2) Requirements Analysis
Requirements Analysis, seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users.

3) Design
The Design phase is the link between the software's purpose (established in the Planning and Requirements Analysis phases) and its execution (defined in the coding phase).

4) Coding/Development
The Coding phase is when engineers and developers get down to business and start converting the software design into tangible code.

5) Testing
Software testing involves a thorough examination of the software for any bugs or glitches that might have slipped through during coding.

6) Deployment
The Deployment phase involves rolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users.

7) Maintenance
Tmaintenance phase is characterized by constant assistance and improvement, which guarantees the software's best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
