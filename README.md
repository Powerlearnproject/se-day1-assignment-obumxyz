#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer:

Software engineering is applying engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.

Importance of Software engineering in the technology industry;

1) Enables Innovation: Software Engineering is at the heart of innovation in technology. It allows us to create new applications, products, and services that drive progress and improve our lives. 

2) Ensures Reliability: Proper Software Engineering practices lead to more reliable and stable software, reducing the likelihood of crashes, errors, and system failures. This is crucial for critical applications in healthcare, transportation, and finance. 

3) Efficiency and Performance: Well-engineered software is optimised for efficiency and performance. It can handle tasks faster, consume fewer resources, and deliver a better user experience. 

4) Scalability and Adaptability: Software Engineering principles facilitate the development of scalable software that can grow with increasing demands. It also allows for easy adaptation to changing requirements and technologies. 

5) Cost-effective Solutions: Investing in Software Engineering upfront can lead to cost savings in the long run. Properly designed and maintained software requires fewer resources for maintenance and support. 

6) Security and Privacy: Software Engineering practices include security considerations, helping to protect data and systems from cyber threats. This is particularly crucial in an era of increasing digital vulnerabilities. 

7) Rapid Development and Iteration: Modern Software Engineering methodologies, such as Agile and DevOps, enable rapid development and iterative improvements, ensuring that software can keep up with evolving user needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer:

1) Mastering Machine (1956-1967)

2) Mastering Process (1968-1982)

3) Mastering Complexity (1983-1992)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Answer:

1) Planning: Planning, involves defining the software's purpose and scope, much like pinpointing our destination and plotting the best route.

2) Requirements Analysis: Requirements Analysis, seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users.

3) Design: The Design phase is the link between the software's purpose (established in the Planning and Requirements Analysis phases) and its execution (defined in the coding phase).

4) Coding/Development: The Coding phase is when engineers and developers get down to business and start converting the software design into tangible code.

5) Testing: Software testing involves a thorough examination of the software for any bugs or glitches that might have slipped through during coding.

6) Deployment: The Deployment phase involves rolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users.

7) Maintenance: The maintenance phase is characterized by constant assistance and improvement, which guarantees the software's best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Answer:

While the Agile methodology is more open to ongoing collaboration and unexpected changes, the waterfall model follows a highly structured path.

Appropriate Scenarios for Waterfall Methodology
1. Government Projects or Regulatory Systems: A government agency requires the development of a software system to handle sensitive and highly regulated data, such as tax collection or social security benefits.

2. Construction and Infrastructure Software: A software system is being developed to manage large-scale infrastructure projects, like the planning and tracking of a dam construction.

3. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems: An organization needs an ERP system to manage its core business functions (finance, HR, supply chain management) across various departments.
  
4. Embedded Systems or Firmware: Development of embedded software for medical devices (e.g., a pacemaker or infusion pump) that must adhere to stringent regulatory standards.


Appropriate Scenarios Agile Methodology
1. Startups and MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Development: A startup is developing a mobile app that connects people with local fitness trainers.

2. Mobile App Development: Developing a mobile app for real-time ride-sharing (like Uber or Lyft).

3. Web Development: Developing an e-commerce platform that needs continuous updates and improvements, such as adding new payment options, customer review features, or integrating with third-party services.

4. Games Development: Developing an online multiplayer game, where player interaction, feedback, and balancing of features are integral to the development process.

5. Software with Evolving Requirements (SaaS): A SaaS platform that provides accounting services for small businesses, which continuously evolves with the release of new accounting regulations or integration with other software.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Answer:

1) Software developers design, program, build, deploy and maintain software using many different skills and tools.

2) Quality Assurance Engineer spend most of their time assessing the software for bugs, suggesting changes and ensuring it meets quality standards.

3) Project managers in software organize software projects and can assign tasks to software engineering teams according to the specifications of a task.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Answer:

An integrated development environment (IDE) provides software developers with all the tools they require to complete projects in a central location. (E.g, IntelliJ IDEA)

Version Control Systems makes it easier for software teams to collaborate, maintain clean code and fix mistakes. (E.g, GitHub)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
